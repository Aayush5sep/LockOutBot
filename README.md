## Update (As of 20th March 2023)

The bot has been redesigned with the new Open Registration Round Option added alongwith the previous challenge round.
The .round functions have been changed. Other Commands will be also checked re-again for their working with the asynchronous initalization of Lockout Bot.
Your support will be appreciated to upgrade this bot.
